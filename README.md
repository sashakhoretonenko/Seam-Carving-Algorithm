# Seam-Carving-Algorithm

Uses Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm to reduce the size of an image by removing vertical and horizontal seams.

SeamCarver.java takes an input of "filename" "number of horizontal seams you want to remove" "number of vertical seams you want to remove"

I've provided 2 testing files.
